# Test Servers

A set of test servers running in Virtualbox locally and bootstrapped with vagrant. These boxes are just for tetsing purposes of the [microblog project](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog).


How to use:


* Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads). 
    * For Windows hosts only: because windows is *special*, you will need to install the vagrant VBox Guest plugin: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`.


* Clone this repo, go to this directory, run `vagrant up`.
* test the repo using `vagrant ssh`.
